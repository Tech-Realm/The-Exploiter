# The Exploiter

## Overview
The Exploiter is a project that contains multiple hacking tools, including Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Dirb, and more. It runs all of the tools and stores the output in a tree format. The project is currently working on an AI model that will be trained on written bug bounty reports. This will allow it to generate output in a word format, like a bug report, including the impact of the vulnerability.

## Repository
All of the hacking tools are included in a single repository to make it easy to get started with the project.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have a new tool to add, a bug to fix, or a feature to implement, please submit a pull request.

## Usage
To use The Exploiter, simply clone the repository and run the scripts for the tools you want to use. You can also use the main script to run all of the tools at once.

## License
The Exploiter is released under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more information.
